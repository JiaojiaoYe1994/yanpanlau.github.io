Ben Lau

A native HongKonger. Ben traveled to America to pursue his postgraduate studies at Princeton University, where he obtained a Ph.D. in Physics. He then worked for various investment banks, initially as quantitative analyst, then later specializing in financial engineering. 

My research interests involved in artificial intelligence, specifically in deep learning and reinforcement learning. I am also interested in the relationships between Deep Learning and Statistical Mechanics. My previous works involved in Hidden Markov Model and Wavelet analysis of the time-series.
