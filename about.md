A native HongKonger. Ben travelled to America to puruse his postgraduate studies at Princeton University, where he successfully defended his thesis and obtained a Ph.D. in physics. He then worked for various investment banks, initially as quantitative analyst, then later specialising in financial engineering. My research interests involved in artificial intelligence, specifically in deep learning and reinforcement learning. I am also interested in the relationship between Deep Learning and Statistical Mechanics. My previous work involved in Hidden Markov Model / Conditional Random Fields and Wavelet analysis of the time-series.
